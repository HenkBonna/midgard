#### GAMEPLAY NOTES

### PRESENTATION STUFFS
    When the transition plays, the screen can be letterboxed, to make it seem more
    cinematic
    Font with a title card for each ANIMALS
        Sorta like boss titles in Zelda
        Individual title cards for each animal, 
        in the style of the animal, or the vibe of the gampelay
    All music is MIDI, and reacts to the game.
